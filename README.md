# Python Training
# Git commands
git status  : checks status of files in your local directory.
git add filename : adds file to be tracked, use your filename
git commit -m "example message" : commits the file or changes to your local git repository.
git pull origin master : pulls changes from origin , thats github on the cloud to your local repository.
Its a good idea to always pull before you push, to pick up any changes that anyone may have made to master before you push your changes.
git push origin master : pushes your local repository changes to origin "github on the cloud" in the master branch of your repository.

Notes for later:
Later we will cover other branches such as dev.
Later we will cover merges, and resolving merge conflicts.
Later we will cover reset, rolling back to a previous version.
